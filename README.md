# Nicole-Rocks
Hi, I'm Nicole.  I will admit I'm feeling more comfortable with Spyder and Jupyter than Github.  But I'm pushing through.  Practice makes perfect, right.  I like to sing and have been to Carnegie Hall.  And I teach/taught math.  So both of these use the same part of the brain as coding.  I already feel at home.
